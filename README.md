# Rock Paper Scissors by Dylan Gonzalez

This is my Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project. 

It allows you to play a 5-round game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer and displays the winner. 

The game was completed using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

The game is NOT responsive. I might come back and update it to be responsive at some point, but for now, it has to be played on a computer viewport to be displayed correctly.
